# Unified Observability 

## How Oracle tech is or will be used in the game

Also...

The game is built upon the [Simplify Microservices with Converged Oracle Database Workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=637)

The workshop uses the same Unified Observability framework that is OpenTelemetry based and goes from request end to end and into the database - a one of a kind offering.
