## How Oracle tech is or will be used in the game

The game is built upon the [Simplify Microservices with Converged Oracle Database Workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=637)

3d scans of people are used in the game currently.

Auto spatial processing, rigging, animation, and runtime import is partially implemented.
