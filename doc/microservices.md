# Microservices in various languages using various datatypes such as JSON, Relational (JSON Duality), Graph, Spatial, etc.


## How Oracle tech is or will be used in the game

The game is built upon the [Simplify Microservices with Converged Oracle Database Workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=637)

The targets shot in the game map directly to actual Kubernetes deployment pods on the backend cluster.

The backend logic for the game (the control plane if you will) is itself a (Spring Boot) microservice.

The workshop uses the following languages and frameworks and many more.
