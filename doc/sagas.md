# Sagas

## How Oracle tech is or will be used in the game

The game is built upon the [Simplify Microservices with Converged Oracle Database Workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=637)

Sagas are used in the workshop for data integrity of microservices.

### More blogs including use of Oracle Database Saga Engine, Reservationless locking, Auto-compensating datatypes, and use in APEX workflow will be out in early April and will be incorporated into the game along with chaos testing.
