## Hardware requirements

- Laptop - still testing just how little power is necessary but the game is not resource intensive and runs on older mac and windows laptops
- Atari 2600 Joysticks and an iCode USB adapter for them. No driver is needed. Standard keyboard mapping controls will also work but joysticks are more enjoyable and fit the retro motif.
- Speakers - very important for any video game and there are spatial audio and 2 player sound aspects to the game that make good speakers a great enhancement.
- Monitors - only one monitor is need to play the game, which is a two player split screen game, however, observability of the game from DevOps to DataOps, can be viewed in sync with gameplay on the separate monitor.
